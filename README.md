# IoT-Based-Forest-Monitoring-System

The IoT-Based Forest Management System is an innovative solution that leverages
sensor networks and real-time data processing to enhance forest safety and
conservation efforts. The system integrates various sensors, including temperature
and humidity sensors (DHT11), a motion sensor (PIR), a flame sensor, a gas sensor
(MQ-135), and a GPS module, to detect environmental changes and potential
threats.
The collected data is processed using an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted to
a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring. This project aims to mitigate risks
such as forest fires, illegal intrusions, and hazardous gas emissions, contributing to
effective environmental conservation strategies
